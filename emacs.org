* Intro
This file contains my Emacs configuration. I usually run Emacs as a daemon using a [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=181bd848eb9662759f076b31a32f6588e9eb58b4][systemd service]]; the configuration is loaded upon login. To start a new frame, I call =emacsclient -c=. I've setup a desktop file to make that easier (and so I don't have to fire up a terminal to run Emacs). This seems to work better if all the packages are installed already, which is the case unless my =elpa/= folder got deleted or I'm setting up a new machine. To do that, I can just stop the systemd service and start Emacs normally.
** Always demand
The [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] package, which I ensured was installed in [[file:init.el][init.el]], is a convenient way of keeping track of packages. It also really cleverly delays loading packages until they're actually needed, thus (greatly) reducing Emacs's startup time. However, I usually run Emacs as a [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=181bd848eb9662759f076b31a32f6588e9eb58b4][systemd unit]]. Since that's the case, I'd really rather Emacs just go ahead and load everything up:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (daemonp)
      (setq use-package-always-demand t))
#+END_SRC

* Behavior
Change some of emacs's defaults because they suck:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
  (setq use-dialog-box nil) ; don't use popup boxes, just make the minibuffer ask
#+END_SRC

Setup a personal keymap. I'll bind various things to this later on:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys :prefix "<f1>"
             :prefix-map my/map)
#+END_SRC

To quickly access scratch press =my/map f1=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/get-scratch ()
    "Switch to scratch buffer."
    (interactive)
    (switch-to-buffer "*scratch*"))
  (bind-key "<f1>" #'my/get-scratch 'my/map)
#+END_SRC

C-x C-c is originally bound to kill emacs. I accidentally type this from time to time which is super-frustrating.
Similarly, C-x C-z calls =suspend-frame=, which I never want to use.
Get rid of it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (unbind-key "C-x C-c")
  (unbind-key "C-x C-z")
#+END_SRC

In my world, =C-z= is undo, not minimize emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "C-z" #'undo)
#+END_SRC

I don't work much with emacs-lisp, so the scratch buffer shouldn't be in emacs-lisp mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-major-mode #'org-mode
        initial-scratch-message "# This buffer is for notes you don't want to save\n\n")
#+END_SRC

Ignore file case when trying to find stuff:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq read-file-name-completion-ignore-case t)
#+END_SRC

Delete my files by moving them to the trash. I'm human and occasionally delete things that I actually want later:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq delete-by-moving-to-trash t)
#+END_SRC

Finally, I set up [[https://github.com/tarsius/no-littering][no-littering]], which helps keep my .emacs.d folder clean by putting files into appropriate subfolders rather than letting them get saved all over the place:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package no-littering
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/var/custom-file.el"))
#+END_SRC

We can pop the mark back to where it used to be with =C-u C-SPC=. This lets us keep popping by hitting =C-SPC=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq set-mark-command-repeat-pop t)
#+END_SRC

** Alerts
Set it up so Emacs can send system notifications:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package alert
    :ensure t
    :config
    (if (executable-find "notify-send")
        (setq alert-default-style 'libnotify)))
#+END_SRC

** Exec path from shell
This ensures Emacs has the same PATH as the rest of my system:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package exec-path-from-shell
    :ensure t
    :if (or (eq system-type 'darwin)
            (eq system-type 'gnu/linux))
    :config
    (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))
#+END_SRC

** UTF-8
Pretty please use utf-8 for all the things:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC

** Info+
Emacs' info manual is /amazing/. This makes it even better.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package info+
    :ensure t
    :after info)
#+END_SRC

** Aesthetics
*** Theme
By default, emacs starts with a blindingly white theme. Let's get rid of that pronto.
The way I load the theme depends on if Emacs is started as a window or in the terminal. Because of the way Emacs handles themes, I have to load the theme after I make the first frame if I'm starting a daemon. Finally, I don't want to reload the theme after making new frames, so I have to take that into account too!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package spacemacs-theme
    :ensure t
    :init
    ;; theme
    (defvar my/theme 'spacemacs-dark
      "The theme I'm using.")
    (defvar my/theme-window-loaded nil)
    (defvar my/theme-terminal-loaded nil)
    (if (daemonp)
        (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions
                  (lambda (frame)
                    (select-frame frame)
                    (if (window-system frame)
                        (unless my/theme-window-loaded
                          (if my/theme-terminal-loaded
                              (enable-theme my/theme)
                            (load-theme my/theme t))
                          (setq my/theme-window-loaded t))
                      (unless my/theme-terminal-loaded
                        (if my/theme-window-loaded
                            (enable-theme my/theme)
                          (load-theme my/theme t))
                        (setq my/theme-terminal-loaded t)))))
      (progn
        (load-theme my/theme t)
        (if (display-graphic-p)
            (setq my/theme-window-loaded t)
          (setq my/theme-terminal-loaded t))))
    :config
    ;; make diff chunks stand out a bit more:
    (set-face-background 'magit-diff-hunk-heading-highlight "#5d4d7a")
    (set-face-attribute 'org-agenda-date-today nil :height 2.0))
#+END_SRC
*** Fonts
Set up the default fixed pitch font:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
               '(font . "Source Code Pro-12"))
#+END_SRC

Emacs was an editor originally designed for code, so it defaults to a fixed-width font for most things.
It's perfectly capable of handling variable-pitch fonts, though.
The built-in command =variable-pitch-mode= can do that for any buffer.
However, I oftentimes work in a buffer (like this one) that mixes things that I'd prefer to be fixed-width (e.g. code) and variable width (this text).
You can convince Emacs to use fixed-width for some faces and variable-width fonts for others, but you have to specify what faces should be what.
Luckily, [[https://ogbe.net/emacsconfig.html][someone]] has already figured this out.
I took their code, modified it to work more like what I want, and packaged it up.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mixed-pitch
    :load-path "pkg/mixed-pitch"
    :bind
    (:map my/map
          ("f" . mixed-pitch-mode))
    :config
   (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Linux Libertine" :height 165))
#+END_SRC

*** Text wrapping

Columns should wrap around 80ish characters. 70 is the default, which is just a tad too short I think:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default fill-column 80)
#+END_SRC

Turn on visual line mode for nice line wrapping

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-visual-line-mode)
#+END_SRC

I like lines wrapping at around 80 characters.
Fun nugget: the reason \LaTeX default margins look so huge isn't because the margins are too big.
It's because [[https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/09/15/the-paper-is-too-big/][the paper is too big]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package visual-fill-column
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (:map my/map
          ("v" . visual-fill-column-mode))
    :config
    (add-hook 'elfeed-show-mode-hook #'visual-fill-column-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Highlight numbers
I like to see numbers in code:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package highlight-numbers
    :ensure t
    :commands (highlight-numbers-mode)
    :init
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'highlight-numbers-mode)
    (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook #'highlight-numbers-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Color words describing colors
Rainbow-mode makes it so that for example #0000ff is displayed in white with a blue background.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-mode
    :ensure t
    :config
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-mode)
    (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook #'rainbow-mode)
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'rainbow-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Scrolling
Emacs has some awful scrolling by default. This gets rid of that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))) ; one line at a time
  (setq mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil) ; don't accelerate scrolling
  (setq mouse-wheel-follow-mouse 't) ; scroll window under mouse
  (setq scroll-step 1) ; keyboard scroll one line at a time
  (setq scroll-preserve-screen-position t)
  (setq scroll-conservatively 101)
  (setq view-read-only t) ; open read only buffers in view-mode
  ;; the defaults C-v and M-v scroll a full page, which is too much.
  ;; rebind to a half page:
  (use-package view
    :bind
    ("C-v" . View-scroll-half-page-forward)
    ("M-v" . View-scroll-half-page-backward))
#+END_SRC

** Smart parens
I'm not good at keeping track of parentheses. This makes me slightly better at it. It also keeps track of other things that should "match" like {}, [], "", ``'' (in latex mode), etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package smartparens
    :ensure t
    :demand t
    :bind
    (:map smartparens-mode-map
          ("C-M-a" . sp-beginning-of-sexp)
          ("C-M-e" . sp-end-of-sexp)
          ("C-M-f" . sp-forward-sexp)
          ("C-M-b" . sp-backward-sexp)
          ("M-]" . sp-unwrap-sexp)
          :map prog-mode-map
          ("M-<right>" . sp-next-sexp)
          ("M-<left>" . sp-previous-sexp)
          ("C-<right>" . sp-forward-slurp-sexp)
          ("C-<left>" . sp-forward-barf-sexp))
    :config
    (use-package smartparens-config)
    (setq sp-show-pair-from-inside t)
    (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook #'smartparens-strict-mode)
    (smartparens-global-strict-mode)
    (show-smartparens-global-mode))
#+END_SRC

** PDF viewer
I like emacs, so why not view PDFs in it? Build the server when it asks - this may take a second.

NOTE: ~pdf-tools~ only officially supports gnu/linux operating systems. I think that it will work on macs as well, but you may have to finagle it a bit. Regardless, I tell emacs to only use it if the OS is linux based.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pdf-tools
    :ensure t
    :if (eq system-type 'gnu/linux)
    :config
    ;; Use C-RET in latex mode to jump to location in pdf file
    (setq pdf-sync-forward-display-pdf-key "<C-return>")
    ;; The t says to install the server without asking me
    (pdf-tools-install t)
    ;; Show full pages by default instead of fitting page width:
    (setq-default pdf-view-display-size 'fit-page)
    ;; Use pdf-tools to display pdfs from latex runs:
    (setq TeX-view-program-selection '((output-pdf "pdf-tools")))
    (setq TeX-view-program-list '(("pdf-tools" "TeX-pdf-tools-sync-view"))))
#+END_SRC

** Async
Async is written to let things be more async-y in Emacs. I use it for dired-async mode mostly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package async
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq dired-async-message-function
          ;; For whatever reason, the default for this *doesn't* log it to
          ;; *Messages*. Instead, it just displays the notification in the mode
          ;; line for 3 seconds, but if you type something it immediately goes
          ;; away. So just log it to *Messages* like a sane person instead:
          (lambda (text face &rest args)
            (message (format "Finished %s" (apply #'format text args)))))
    ;; do dired actions asynchronously
    (dired-async-mode))
#+END_SRC

** File finder (Dired)
Emacs can act as your file finder/explorer. Dired is the built-in way to do this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "C-x C-d" #'dired) ; overrides list-directory, which I never use
  (setq dired-auto-revert-buffer t)
  (setq dired-dwim-target t)
  (setq dired-recursive-copies (quote always))
  (setq dired-recursive-deletes (quote always))
  (bind-key "l" #'dired-up-directory dired-mode-map) ; use l to go up in dired
  ;; -l: long listing format REQUIRED in dired-listing-switches
  ;; -a: show everything (including dotfiles)
  ;; -h: human-readable file sizes
  (setq dired-listing-switches "-alh --group-directories-first")
#+END_SRC

List directory sizes using ~du~:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dired-du
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (:map dired-mode-map
          ("S" . dired-du-mode))
    :config
    (setq dired-du-size-format t)
    (defun my/dired-maybe-hide-details ()
      "Hide details (owner, permissions, etc) in dired unless dired-du-mode is active."
      (unless dired-du-mode (dired-hide-details-mode)))
    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook #'my/dired-maybe-hide-details))
#+END_SRC

This lets me make directories on the fly similar to =mkdir -p=. [[http://mbork.pl/2016-07-25_Making_directories_on_the_fly][Thanks!]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun make-parent-directory ()
    "Make sure the directory of `buffer-file-name' exists."
    (make-directory (file-name-directory buffer-file-name) t))

  (add-hook 'find-file-not-found-functions #'make-parent-directory)
#+END_SRC

By default, dired asks you if you want to delete the dired buffer if you delete the folder. I can't think of a reason I'd ever want to do that, so just automate it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-advice dired-clean-up-after-deletion
      (:around (old-fun &rest r) kill-dired-buffer-quietly)
    (define-advice y-or-n-p (:around (old-fun prompt) just-yes)
      (if (string-prefix-p "Kill Dired buffer" prompt)
          t
        (funcall old-fun prompt)))
    (unwind-protect (apply old-fun r)
      (advice-remove 'y-or-n-p #'y-or-n-p@just-yes)))
#+END_SRC

** Modeline
The default modeline is nice enough, but this one is much better looking:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package spaceline-config
    :ensure spaceline
    :config
    (setq spaceline-window-numbers-unicode t)
    (setq spaceline-workspace-numbers-unicode t)
    (spaceline-helm-mode)
    (spaceline-info-mode)
    (setq-default
     powerline-default-separator 'wave
     spaceline-flycheck-bullet "❖ %s"
     spaceline-separator-dir-left '(right . right)
     spaceline-separator-dir-right '(left . left))
    (spaceline-install
      'main
      '((window-number)
        (buffer-modified)
        (projectile-root)
        ((remote-host buffer-id) :face highlight-face)
        (major-mode)
        (process :when active))
      '((selection-info :face region :when mark-active)
        ((flycheck-error flycheck-warning flycheck-info) :when active)
        (which-function)
        (version-control :when active)
        (line-column)
        (global :when active)
        (buffer-position)))
    (setq-default mode-line-format '("%e" (:eval (spaceline-ml-main)))))
#+END_SRC
Also, we can substitute the [[http://fontawesome.io/icon/code-fork/][code fork]] from [[http://fontawesome.io/icon/code-fork/][font awesome]] (which you'll need to have installed) to have a pretty symbol instead of "git:branch"
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my-vc-git-mode-line-string (orig-fn &rest args)
    "Replace Git in modeline with font-awesome git icon via ORIG-FN and ARGS."
    (let ((str (apply orig-fn args)))
      (concat [#xF126] " " (substring-no-properties str 4))))

  (advice-add #'vc-git-mode-line-string :around #'my-vc-git-mode-line-string)
#+END_SRC

** Which-key
[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][Which key]] shows key bindings for incomplete commands (prefixes).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure t
    :commands which-key-mode
    :config
    (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Window management
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq split-height-threshold nil) ; Don't split windows vertically
#+END_SRC

These functions make splitting windows behave more like I want it to. This way, calling ~C-x 2~ or ~C-x 3~ both splits the window /and/ shows the last buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
  (defun my/vsplit-last-buffer (prefix)
    "Split the window vertically and display the previous buffer."
    (interactive "p")
    (split-window-vertically)
    (other-window 1 nil)
    (if (= prefix 1)
        (switch-to-next-buffer)))
  (defun my/hsplit-last-buffer (prefix)
    "Split the window horizontally and display the previous buffer."
    (interactive "p")
    (split-window-horizontally)
    (other-window 1 nil)
    (if (= prefix 1) (switch-to-next-buffer)))
  (bind-keys ("C-x 2" . my/vsplit-last-buffer)
             ("C-x 3" . my/hsplit-last-buffer))
#+END_SRC

*** Window switching
I can use [[https://github.com/deb0ch/emacs-winum][winum]] to quickly jump from window to window.
This replaces =window-numbering= since =winum= can handle assigning numbers across multiple frames.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package winum
    :ensure t
    :init
    (setq winum-keymap
          (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
            (bind-key (kbd "M-0") #'winum-select-window-0-or-10 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-1") #'winum-select-window-1 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-2") #'winum-select-window-2 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-3") #'winum-select-window-3 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-4") #'winum-select-window-4 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-5") #'winum-select-window-5 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-6") #'winum-select-window-6 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-7") #'winum-select-window-7 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-8") #'winum-select-window-8 map)
            (bind-key (kbd "M-9") #'winum-select-window-9 map)
            map))
    :config
    (setq winum-scope 'frame-local)
    (setq winum-auto-setup-mode-line nil)
    (winum-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Frame management
Prompt me to save changed buffers if I'm closing the last frame (and Emacs is running as a daemon):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (daemonp)
      (progn
        (defun my/save-if-last-frame (frame)
          (when (eq 1 (cl-count-if
                       (lambda (f)
                         (eq
                          (frame-parameter f 'display)
                          (frame-parameter frame 'display)))
                       (visible-frame-list)))
            (save-some-buffers)))

        (add-to-list 'delete-frame-functions #'my/save-if-last-frame)))

#+END_SRC

** Transposing
I can use this package to swap the window layout easily:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package transpose-frame
    :ensure t
    :commands (transpose-frame))
#+END_SRC

And then I can setup a nice transpose keymap. Note that transpose-words is also bound to =M-t=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys :prefix "C-t"
             :prefix-map transpose-map
             ("f" . transpose-frame)
             ("c" . transpose-chars)
             ("w" . transpose-words)
             ("l" . transpose-lines)
             ("p" . transpose-paragraphs)
             ("s" . transpose-sentences)
             ("x" . transpose-sexps))
#+END_SRC
** Server
Start the server:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package server
    :if window-system
    :config
    (unless (server-running-p)
      (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'server-start t)))
#+END_SRC
** Crux
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux/blob/master/crux.el][Crux]] is a collection of useful extensions. Here I bind some of the more useful functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package crux
    :ensure t
    :bind
    (("C-x i" . crux-ispell-word-then-abbrev)
     ("C-c e" . crux-sudo-edit)
     :map prog-mode-map
     ("C-a" . crux-move-beginning-of-line))
    :config
    (setq save-abbrevs 'silently)
    (setq-default abbrev-mode t))
#+END_SRC

** Help windows
You can use =C-h f=, =C-h v= and others to read docs for functions, variables, etc. This makes emacs switch focus to these windows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq help-window-select t)
#+END_SRC
** popwin
[[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][popwin]] describes itself as freeing me from the hell of annoying buffers. Let's see if that's true:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popwin
    :ensure t
    :config
    ;; Helper functions from the helm wiki to deal with help windows and a weird
    ;; interaction between helm and popwin:
    (defun *-popwin-help-mode-off ()
      "Turn `popwin-mode' off for *Help* buffers."
      (when (boundp 'popwin:special-display-config)
        (customize-set-variable 'popwin:special-display-config
                                (delq 'help-mode popwin:special-display-config))))
    (defun *-popwin-help-mode-on ()
      "Turn `popwin-mode' on for *Help* buffers."
      (when (boundp 'popwin:special-display-config)
        (customize-set-variable 'popwin:special-display-config
                                (add-to-list 'popwin:special-display-config 'help-mode nil #'eq))))
    (add-hook 'helm-minibuffer-set-up-hook #'*-popwin-help-mode-off)
    (add-hook 'helm-cleanup-hook #'*-popwin-help-mode-on)
    ;; Turn on popwin
    (popwin-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Encryption
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package epa
    :config
    (setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback))
#+END_SRC
** Passwords
I use [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] to manage all my passwords and login info. This lets me easily access it from within emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package password-store
    :ensure t
    :if (executable-find "pass")
    :demand t
    :init
    (use-package auth-password-store
      :ensure t)
    :config
    (setq password-store-password-length 20)
    (use-package helm-pass
      :load-path "pkg/helm-pass"
      :after 'helm
      :bind ("M-s p" . helm-pass)))
#+END_SRC
** Try
This package lets me try out other packages before installing them by installing them to tmp:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package try
    :ensure t
    :commands (try))
#+END_SRC

** Undo-tree
Emacs undo system is incredibly powerful but a bit confusing. This package has a great visualization system that helps out, bound to =C-x u= by default.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :ensure t
    :init
    (global-undo-tree-mode)
    :config
    (setq undo-tree-visualizer-timestamps t)
    (setq undo-tree-visualizer-diff t))
#+END_SRC

** Hydra
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][Hydra]] is a nice package that lets you set up menus for related (or not) commands.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hydra
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Move buffers
Sometimes the buffers are in the wrong places. This lets me move them around.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package buffer-move
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ("M-S-<up>" . buf-move-up)
    ("M-S-<down>" . buf-move-down)
    ("M-S-<left>" . buf-move-left)
    ("M-S-<right>" . buf-move-right)
    :config
    (setq buffer-move-behavior 'move))
#+END_SRC

Here's a quick [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]] that I wrote to quickly move buffers from window to window:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defhydra hydra-window ()
    "window management"
    ("l" buf-move-left "left")
    ("r" buf-move-right "right")
    ("d" buf-move-down "down")
    ("u" buf-move-up "up"))
  (bind-key "C-c m b" #'hydra-window/body)
#+END_SRC

** Auto indent

[[https://github.com/Malabarba/aggressive-indent-mode][Aggressive indent mode]] keeps code indented automatically, even after rearranging stuff:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package aggressive-indent
    :ensure t
    :config
    (global-aggressive-indent-mode)
    )
#+END_SRC

** System management
*** System packages
This is a collection of functions I wrote to help me manage installed system packages with emacs. You can find the package [[https://github.com/jabranham/system-packages][on github]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package system-packages
    :load-path "pkg/system-packages"
    :bind ("<f5>" . hydra/system-packages/body)
    :config
    (defhydra hydra/system-packages ()
      "Manage system packages"
      ("i" system-packages-install "install" :exit t)
      ("s" system-packages-search "search" :exit t)
      ("U" system-packages-uninstall "uninstall" :exit t)
      ("u" system-packages-update "update" :exit t)
      ("l" system-packages-list-installed-packages "list installed" :exit t)
      ("O" system-packages-remove-orphaned "remove orphans" :exit t)))
#+END_SRC
*** PKGBUILD
Arch linux uses PKGBUILD files to describe built information for packages. This provides an Emacs mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package pkgbuild-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode ("/PKGBUILD$" . pkgbuild-mode))
#+END_SRC
*** systemd
=systemd= keeps track of daemons running and the like.
This adds syntax highlighting for it (Emacs can do a decent job out-of-the box with =conf-mode=)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package systemd
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

** Multiple cursors
Emacs can support multiple cursors. I don't use this much, but it's super handy when I do need it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package multiple-cursors
    :ensure t
    :demand t
    :commands (mc/edit-lines mc/mark-all-like-this)
    :config
    (bind-keys :prefix "C-c m c"
               :prefix-map multi-cursors-map
               ("l" . mc/edit-lines)
               ("n" . mc/mark-next-like-this)
               ("p" . mc/mark-previous-like-this)
               ("a" . mc/mark-all-like-this)))
#+END_SRC
** Expand region
I can use ~C-=~ to expand the region incrementally:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-=" . er/expand-region))
#+END_SRC
** Browser (eww)
Use Emacs' built in =eww= broswer (the Emacs Web Wowser!) by default.
=browse-url-browser-function= can take a list of regex's and associate a specific browser with matches. So use eww for everything except a few things that don't work well:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq browse-url-browser-function
        '((".*login.utexas.*" . browse-url-firefox)
          (".*utdirect.*utexas.*" . browse-url-firefox)
          (".*reddit.*" . browse-url-firefox)
          (".*github.*" . browse-url-firefox)
          (".*youtube.*" . browse-url-firefox)
          (".*youtu.be*" . browse-url-firefox)
          ("." . eww-browse-url)))
#+END_SRC

If a webpage requires more than eww can handle, I can switch to the system default by tapping =&= or =0=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package eww
    :bind
    (:map eww-mode-map
          ("0" . eww-browse-with-external-browser)))
#+END_SRC

=eww-lnum= makes following links a little easier:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package eww-lnum
    :ensure t
    :after eww
    :bind
    (:map eww-mode-map
          ("f" . eww-lnum-follow)
          ("F" . eww-lnum-universal)))
#+END_SRC

By default, =M-s M-w= searches for text in the region. I overwrite it to search for text in region if active and not whitespace, prompt otherwise:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun eww-search-words ()
    "Search the web for the text between BEG and END.
     If region is active (and not whitespace), search the web for
     the text between BEG and END.  Else, prompt the user for a search
     string.  See the `eww-search-prefix' variable for the search
     engine used."
    (interactive)
    (if (use-region-p)
        (let ((region-string (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))))
          (if (not (string-match-p "\\`[ \n\t\r\v\f]*\\'" region-string))
              (eww region-string)
            (call-interactively 'eww)))
      (call-interactively 'eww)))
#+END_SRC
** Tramp
TRAMP allows me to visit remote files in my local Emacs instance.
It's pretty sweet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package tramp
    :config
    ;; Don't leave histfiles everywhere:
    (setq tramp-histfile-override t)
    ;; Use ssh by default:
    (setq tramp-default-method "ssh")
    ;; Tramp struggles with escaping things properly (dired in particular has issues with spaces/special characters; this is fixed if you build Emacs from the master branch of the git repo; Emacs 26), this fixes it for me:
    (push "QUOTING_STYLE=literal" tramp-remote-process-environment))
#+END_SRC
*** Edit remote file
Edit a remote file with absolute path:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/ssh:username@remote-host:/absolute/path
#+END_EXAMPLE
or with a relative path:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/ssh:username@remote-host:relative/to/home
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Edit local file as root
note the double colon
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/sudo::/path/to/file
#+END_EXAMPLE
but =sudo::= is short for =/sudo:root@localhost= so that works too
*** Edit remote file as root
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/ssh:you@remotehost|sudo:remotehost:/path/to/file
#+END_EXAMPLE
remotehost must be explicitly specified
** Text Misc
I end sentences with a single space.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq sentence-end-double-space nil)
#+END_SRC

=fill-paragraph= is nice, but emacs weirdly lacks a convenient way to unfill paragraphs once they're filled.
This package adds that functionality.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package unfill
    :ensure t)

  (bind-key [remap fill-paragraph] #'unfill-toggle)
#+END_SRC

Sometimes I type DOuble LEtters instead of Single Letter caps. This fixes that:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dcaps-to-scaps ()
    "Convert word in DOuble CApitals to Single Capitals."
    (interactive)
    (and (= ?w (char-syntax (char-before)))
         (save-excursion
           (and (if (called-interactively-p 'any)
                    (skip-syntax-backward "w")
                  (= -3 (skip-syntax-backward "w")))
                (let (case-fold-search)
                  (looking-at "\\b[[:upper:]]\\{2\\}[[:lower:]]"))
                (capitalize-word 1)))))

  (define-minor-mode dubcaps-mode
    "Toggle `dubcaps-mode'.  Converts words in DOuble CApitals to
  Single Capitals as you type."
    :init-value nil
    :lighter (" DC")
    (if dubcaps-mode
        (add-hook 'post-self-insert-hook #'dcaps-to-scaps nil 'local)
      (remove-hook 'post-self-insert-hook #'dcaps-to-scaps 'local)))

  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'dubcaps-mode)
#+END_SRC
** Miscellaneous
Here are a bunch of things I want emacs to do (or not) but don't seem to fit in other sections.

For when I need lots of text:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun lorem ()
    "Insert a lorem ipsum."
    (interactive)
    (insert "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do "
            "eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim"
            "ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut "
            "aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in "
            "reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla "
            "pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in "
            "culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."))
#+END_SRC
*** Disable tooltips
If the mouse goes over a divider between windows, Emacs helpfully tells you what pressing the mouse buttons will do. This is a little annoying, though, so let's disable it:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tooltip-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

*** Make script files executable automatically
Emacs can set file permissions automatically. Make scripts executable so I don't have to remember to do so:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook
            'executable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p)
#+END_SRC
*** Zooming
Everywhere else you can zoom with =C--= and =C-+=. Let's make Emacs follow that convention:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys ("C-+" . text-scale-increase)
             ("C--" . text-scale-decrease))
#+END_SRC
*** Enable disabled commands
Emacs thinks that some new users may find some commands confusing, so they're disabled by default. I use these every now and then, so let's enable them by default:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (put 'downcase-region 'disabled nil)
  (put 'upcase-region 'disabled nil)
  (put 'narrow-to-region 'disabled nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Prettify symbols
Prettify-symbols-mode will replace some symbols (like "lambda") with their prettier cousins (like \lambda).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point 'right-edge)
  (global-prettify-symbols-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Replace selected text
Emacs by default doesn't replace selected text if you start typing over it. Since that's the behavior of virtually all other programs, let's make emacs do that too:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (delete-selection-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Blinking cursor & highlight line
A blinking cursor gets kinda annoying, so get rid of it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (blink-cursor-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

Also, I like the current line to be highlighted. Makes it easy to see where I am:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-hl-line-mode)
#+END_SRC
*** Refresh buffers
Emacs should refresh buffers automatically so if they've changed on disk the buffer will update. I want dired to do this, but don't ask me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)
  (setq auto-revert-verbose nil)
  (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

*** Resize windows
We can resize windows now!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys ("S-C-<left>" . shrink-window-horizontally)
             ("S-C-<right>" . enlarge-window-horizontally)
             ("S-C-<down>" . shrink-window)
             ("S-C-<up>" . enlarge-window))
#+END_SRC
*** Start maximized
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))

#+END_SRC

*** Better defaults
This is inspired by the [[https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults][better defaults]] package, but I don't like everything in there.

Yes, please save my place when opening/closing files:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package saveplace
    :config
    (save-place-mode))
#+END_SRC

Get rid of menu-bar, toolbar, and the scroll bars
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

Don't ever use tabs. Always use spaces.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+END_SRC

Because I'm lazy, I want to just type y or n instead of spelling out yes/no.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

Also, don't ask me when I try to create a new file. Just create it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq confirm-nonexistent-file-or-buffer nil)
#+END_SRC

We can use shift-mouse for selecting from point:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "<S-down-mouse-1>" #'mouse-save-then-kill)
#+END_SRC

Use regex searches by default:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq search-default-mode t)
#+END_SRC

A few final modifications:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t
        mouse-yank-at-point t
        require-final-newline t
        visible-bell nil
        ring-bell-function 'ignore
        load-prefer-newer t)
#+END_SRC
* Auto completion
** Company mode
Company mode provides autocompletion of text and code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company

    (:map company-active-map
          ("C-s" . company-search-candidates)

#+END_SRC

** Yasnippet
Yasnippet allows you to type an abbreviation and then expand it into a template. We can look at yasnippet's documentation [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][on github]].

Yasnippet by default checks for snippets in two places: a path relative to yasnippet.el (these are the default snippets that come with the package). If I want to make my own, I can put then in ~.emacs.d/snippets~ and it should find them there as well.

I integrate yasnippet with hippie-expand so using ~hippie-expand~ expands a snippet if I have one, and then otherwise tries the hippie-expand functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :ensure t
    :after hippie-exp
    :demand t
    :init
    ;; disable yas minor mode map
    ;; use hippie-expand instead
    (setq yas-minor-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
    :config
    (push 'yas-hippie-try-expand hippie-expand-try-functions-list)
    ;; If region selected, wrap snippet around it:
    (setq yas-wrap-around-region t)
    ;; If competing snippets, use completing-read (helm) to select:
    (setq yas-prompt-functions '(yas-completing-prompt))
    (add-hook 'term-mode-hook (lambda () (yas-minor-mode -1)))
    (unbind-key "C-c &" yas-minor-mode-map)
    (yas-global-mode))
#+END_SRC

Yasnippet has a bug that the Spacemacs people figured out a fix for. I've shamelessly copy/pasted the fix here:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Yasnippet and Smartparens

  ;; If enabled, smartparens will mess snippets expanded by `hippie-expand`.
  ;; We want to temporarily disable Smartparens during the snippet expansion and
  ;; switch it back to the initial state when done.
  ;;
  ;; However, there is an asymmetry in Yasnippet's hooks:
  ;; * `yas-before-expand-snippet-hook' is called for all snippet expansions,
  ;; including the nested ones.
  ;; * `yas-after-exit-snippet-hook' is called only for the top level snippet,
  ;; but NOT for the nested ones.
  ;;
  ;; That's why we introduce `spacemacs--yasnippet-expanding' below.

  (defvar spacemacs--smartparens-enabled-initially t
    "Stored whether smartparens is originally enabled or not.")
  (defvar spacemacs--yasnippet-expanding nil
    "Whether the snippet expansion is in progress.")

  (defun spacemacs//smartparens-disable-before-expand-snippet ()

#+END_SRC

** Insert file name

This function ([[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/insert-file-name/][credit]]) lets me insert a file name easily. Defaults to relative path, use the universal argument to get the absolute path.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/insert-file-name (filename &optional args)

    name from current directory, `default-directory'.  See
    `file-relative-name'.

** Go to this file
It's nice to have a function to find this file quickly. Here's one:


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/find-emacs-file ()
    "Find my emacs org file"

#+END_SRC
** Narrowing
Emacs has a great system to "narrow" a buffer to just a smaller bit. This is useful in a whole bunch of unexpected ways. For example, if a function will do something to a whole buffer but you only want to apply it to part, you can just narrow to that bit of the buffer. Or narrow just to one org subtree when you have a massive org document. The narrow commands are a bit confusing by default. This cleans them up a bit and makes it more intuitive to use. I got this from [[http://endlessparentheses.com/emacs-narrow-or-widen-dwim.html][this post]] (modified a bit).
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun narrow-or-widen-dwim (p)
    "Widen if buffer is narrowed, narrow-dwim otherwise.
  Dwim means: region, org-src-block, org-subtree, or
  defun, whichever applies first. Narrowing to
  org-src-block actually calls `org-edit-src-code'.

  With prefix P, don't widen, just narrow even if buffer
  is already narrowed."
    (interactive "P")
    (declare (interactive-only))
    (cond ((and (buffer-narrowed-p) (not p)) (widen))
          ((region-active-p)

** Helm and makefiles
I can setup helm to deal with makefiles easily:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-make
    :ensure t
    :after projectile
    :init
    ;; scroll the compile buffer just until an error occurs
    (setq compilation-scroll-output 'first-error))
#+END_SRC
** Helm and snippets
I can use this when I can't remember the exact name of a snippet.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package helm-c-yasnippet
    :after yasnippet
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ("M-`" . helm-yas-complete))
#+END_SRC

* Projectile
Projectile makes using projects easier in emacs. It also plays well with helm, so let's set that up.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    :ensure t
    :config
    (projectile-mode)
    (bind-key "c" #'helm-make-projectile projectile-command-map)
    (use-package helm-projectile
      :ensure t
      :config
      (setq projectile-completion-system 'helm)
      (helm-projectile-on)))
#+END_SRC

* Org
Org mode is a great thing. I use it for writing academic papers, managing my schedule, managing my references and notes, writing presentations, writing lecture slides, and pretty much anything else. This file is written in org-mode.

Define =C-c l= to =org-store-link=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "C-c l" #'org-store-link)
#+END_SRC
Define some places where I keep tasks and notes.
I sync the org repo with Syncthing.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-directory "~/org/")
  (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "todo.org"))
  (defconst my/org-inbox (concat org-directory "refile.org")
    "Inbox for tasks/todo.")
  (defconst my/org-notes (concat org-directory "notes.org")
    "Long-term storage for notes.")
  (defconst my/org-scheduled (concat org-directory "scheduled.org")
    "Scheduled tasks.")
#+END_SRC
Finally, I rebind =C-c C-r= to look at my reference list globally (see org-ref below), which overrides the default binding of =org-reveal=. However, that command is quite useful, so let's bind it to =C-c r=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "C-c r" #'org-reveal org-mode-map)
#+END_SRC

Bind =M-p= and =M-n= to navigate heading more easily (these are bound to =C-c C-p/n= by default):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-keys :map org-mode-map
             ("M-p" . org-previous-visible-heading)
             ("M-n" . org-next-visible-heading))
#+END_SRC
** Calendar
Not technically part of org, but I'll stick the calendar config here since I mainly use it along with org-agenda (config'ed below)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package calendar
    ;; built-in, :ensure t not necessary
    :config
    (calendar-set-date-style 'iso)
    (setq calendar-week-start-day 0) ; weeks start on Sunday
    (setq calendar-date-display-form calendar-iso-date-display-form)
    (setq holiday-christian-holidays nil)
    (setq holiday-bahai-holidays nil)
    (setq holiday-hebrew-holidays nil)
    (setq holiday-islamic-holidays nil)
    (setq holiday-oriental-holidays nil))
#+END_SRC

*** Calfw - calendar
calfw provides a nice calendar view:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package calfw
    :ensure t
    :config
    ;; Use unicode characters
    (setq cfw:fchar-junction ?╋
          cfw:fchar-vertical-line ?┃
          cfw:fchar-horizontal-line ?━
          cfw:fchar-left-junction ?┣
          cfw:fchar-right-junction ?┫
          cfw:fchar-top-junction ?┯
          cfw:fchar-top-left-corner ?┏
          cfw:fchar-top-right-corner ?┓))
#+END_SRC
And we can make it integrate with org-agenda:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package calfw-org
    :ensure t
    :commands (cfw:open-org-calendar)
    :bind
    (:map my/map ("o" . cfw:open-org-calendar))
    :config
    ;; Overwrite some keybindings to be more like org-agenda's:
    (setq cfw:org-overwrite-default-keybinding t)
    ;; Only show items with a timestamp in the calendar:
    (setq cfw:org-agenda-schedule-args '(:timestamp)))
#+END_SRC

** Exporting
HTML and latex shown by default, let's add markdown:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ox-md)
#+END_SRC

This makes org export smart quotes so that it uses ~``word``~ style quotes for latex export:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-with-smart-quotes t)
#+END_SRC

This lets me override all the export variables with a =#+BIND:= statement at the beginning of org-mode files for export:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-export-allow-bind-keywords t)
#+END_SRC

** Code blocks (org-babel)
Org-babel is included in org. We just need to tell it which languages to load. And don't ask us if we're sure we want to run code blocks when we ~C-c C-c~. Finally, open the code block in the current window when we use ~C-'~

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (latex . t)
     (python . t)
     (R . t)
     (shell . t)))
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
  (setq org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
#+END_SRC

*** Code block font locking
This will make the contents of code blocks use the same font locking (syntax highlighting) as the major mode. It'll also make the tab key act like you want it to inside code blocks.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively     t
        org-src-tab-acts-natively    t)
#+END_SRC

*** Adding SRC blocks
Here I define a function ([[https://github.com/vdemeester/emacs-config/blob/master/.emacs.d/emacs.org][thanks!]]) that lets me easily add and edit source blocks in org mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/org-insert-src-block (src-code-type)
    "Insert a `SRC-CODE-TYPE' type source code block in org-mode."
    (interactive

            '("emacs-lisp" "python" "sh" "calc" "R" "latex" "org")))
       (list (completing-read "Source code type: " src-code-types))))
    (progn
      (insert (format "#+BEGIN_SRC %s\n" src-code-type))
      (newline-and-indent)
      (insert "#+END_SRC\n")
      (forward-line -2)
      (org-edit-src-code)))

  (bind-key "C-c s a" #'my/org-insert-src-block org-mode-map)

* Python
The package is called python, the mode is python-mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package python
    :mode ("\\.py\\'". python-mode)
    :interpreter "python")
#+END_SRC

Elpy is a ton of customizations for python. Load it up:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package elpy
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :config
    (elpy-enable)
    (when (require 'flycheck nil t)
      (setq elpy-modules (delq 'elpy-module-flymake elpy-modules))
      (add-hook 'elpy-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)))
#+END_SRC
* Stan
Stan is a Bayesian modeling language. Emacs has a mode for it (of course!)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package stan-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode ("\\.stan\\'". stan-mode))
#+END_SRC
* CSV files
Emacs can handle csv files with ease:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package csv-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode (("\\.csv" . csv-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* Code and syntax checking
Emacs can tell you magically if your code is wrong (or just ugly). Flycheck is a minor mode for this. Let's enable it globally.

Flycheck can check your R code too, but you'll need to install the ~lintr~ package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck ; checks for style and syntax
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc))
    ;; I don't care if code is commented out in R:
    (setq flycheck-lintr-linters "with_defaults(commented_code_linter = NULL)")
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode))
#+END_SRC

Electric operator will turn ~a=10*5+2~ into ~a = 10 * 5 + 2~, so let's enable it for R:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package electric-operator
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq electric-operator-R-named-argument-style 'spaced)
    (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook #'electric-operator-mode)
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'electric-operator-mode))
#+END_SRC
* Whitespace
Whitespace is evil. Let's get rid of as much as possible. But we don't want to do this with files that already had whitespace (from someone else's project, for example). This mode will call ~whitespace-cleanup~ before buffers are saved (but smartly)!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ws-butler
    :ensure t
    :config
    (ws-butler-global-mode))
#+END_SRC

* Markdown
Markdown mode for Markdown editing!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode
    :ensure t
    :commands (markdown-mode gfm-mode)
    :mode (("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
           ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode)
           ("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
    :config
    (setq markdown-enable-math t))
#+END_SRC

Of course, markdown contains a yaml header, so we need yaml-mode as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yaml-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode (("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* LaTeX
AuCTeX is better than the built in tex mode; let's use it. It's good out of the box, but I like to use latexmk so that I don't have to remember to rerun the file X times to get references right.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package tex-site
    :ensure auctex
    :config
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'LaTeX-math-mode)

    (eval-after-load "tex"
      '(add-to-list 'TeX-command-list '("latexmk" "latexmk -synctex=1 -pdf %s"
                                        TeX-run-compile nil t :help "Process file with latexmk")))
    (eval-after-load "tex"

                                        TeX-run-compile nil t :help "Process file with xelatexmk")))
    (add-hook 'TeX-mode-hook (lambda () (setq TeX-command-default "latexmk")))
    ;; Stop littering everywhere with auto/ directories
    (setq-default TeX-auto-local
                  (expand-file-name "auctex/auto" (concat user-emacs-directory "var")))
    ;; Some extra files generated by xelatexmk that I don't generally

    (setq TeX-clean-confirm nil)
    ;; revert pdf from file after compilation finishes
    (use-package tex-buf

    (use-package latex
      :bind
      (:map LaTeX-mode-map
            ("M-p" . outline-previous-visible-heading)
            ("M-n" . outline-next-visible-heading)
            ("<backtab>" . org-cycle))))
#+END_SRC

Finally, sometimes we want wordcounts. If I just want a quick snippet, I can run the following command. If I want more information, I can drop into a shell with ~C-c M-e~ (~shell-pop~) and run ~texcount my-file.tex~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun latex-word-count ()
    (interactive)
    (let* ((this-file (buffer-file-name))
           (word-count
            (with-output-to-string
              (with-current-buffer standard-output
                (call-process "texcount" nil t nil "-brief" this-file)))))
      (string-match "\n$" word-count)
      (message (replace-match "" nil nil word-count))))
#+END_SRC

** Reftex
I use =helm-bibtex= to manage my references, but ReFTeX is still great to have around for cross-references in latex files.

You will need to change ~reftex-default-bibliography~ to wherever you keep your main .bib file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package reftex
    :commands turn-on-reftex
    :init
    (setq reftex-cite-format
          '((?\C-m . "\\cite[]{%l}")
            (?t . "\\citet{%l}")
            (?p . "\\citep[]{%l}")
            (?a . "\\autocite{%l}")
            (?A . "\\textcite{%l}")
            (?P . "[@%l]")
            (?T . "@%l [p. ]")
            (?x . "[]{%l}")
            (?X . "{%l}")))
    (setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Sync/bibliography/references.bib"))
    (setq reftex-bibliography-commands '("bibliography" "nobibliography" "addbibresource"))
    (setq reftex-extra-bindings t)
    :config
    (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'turn-on-reftex))
#+END_SRC

** Latex math
Cdlatex lets me write latex in org-mode. It's particularly useful for math. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/CDLaTeX-mode.html][doc]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package cdlatex
    :ensure t
    :config
    (progn
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-cdlatex-mode)))
#+END_SRC

* Polymode (for knitr)
Polymode is a (relatively new) way of working with multiple major modes. This is especially helpful if we want to use latex or markdown together with R code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package polymode
    :ensure t
    :mode
    ("\\.Snw" . poly-noweb+r-mode)
    ("\\.Rnw" . poly-noweb+r-mode)
    ("\\.[rR]md" . Rmd-mode)
    :init
    (progn
      (defun Rmd-mode ()
        "ESS Markdown mode for Rmd files"
        (interactive)
        (require 'poly-R)
        (require 'poly-markdown)
        (R-mode)
        (poly-markdown+r-mode))))
#+END_SRC

* Spell Check
Flyspell checks for spelling on the fly. I use aspell instead of ispell because it's better. :-) You may need to install it separately, though I didn't need to. If you want to use non-english words, you can tell it so with ~ispell-local-dictionary~ variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flyspell
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq ispell-program-name "aspell")
    (setq ispell-list-command "--list")
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-flyspell)
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
    (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode))
#+END_SRC
* Version control
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq vc-make-backup-files t)
  (setq vc-follow-symlinks t) ; don't ask to follow symlinks
#+END_SRC
** Diff highlights

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-gutter+
    :ensure t
    :init
    (global-git-gutter+-mode)
    :config
    (setq git-gutter+-modified-sign "¤"))
#+END_SRC

** Git & Magit
Magit is better than the command line for git. I don't modify much. I just bind it to =C-x g=. I also set it up that it will run alone in the frame, then restore your previous window configuration when you exit.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit ; for git
    :ensure t
    :pin melpa-stable
    :bind
    ("C-x g" . magit-status)
    :config
    (setq magit-diff-refine-hunk 'all) ; get highlighted word diffs
    (setq magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1))
#+END_SRC

Modes for git files:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gitattributes-mode
    :ensure t)
  (use-package gitconfig-mode
    :ensure t)
  (use-package gitignore-mode
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

And to step through the history of a file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-timemachine
    :ensure t
    :commands (git-timemachine))
#+END_SRC

I autocommit a few files, like notes and todo:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package git-auto-commit-mode
    :ensure t )
#+END_SRC
* Webpage editing
** HTML and friends
Web-mode takes care of a lot of html annoyances:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package web-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode
    ("\\.html?\\'" . web-mode)
    ("\\.scss?\\'" . web-mode)
    ("\\.erb\\'" . web-mode)
    ("\\.djhtml\\'" . web-mode)
    :config
    (setq web-mode-engines-alist
          '(("django" . "\\.djhtml'"))))
#+END_SRC

** CSS, SCSS
And CSS/SCSS is handled nicely by this package:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package scss-mode
    :ensure t
    :mode
    ("\\.css\\'". css-mode)
    ("\\.scss\\'" . scss-mode))
#+END_SRC
* Email
** mu4e setup files
I use ~mu4e~ with mbsync and mu for my email. In order to use this file, you'll need to make sure that mbsync and mu are installed on your system. mbsync requires a bit of configuration to get it started.
** mu4e setup
Finally, we can get mu4e set up.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mu4e
    :if (executable-find "mu")
    :bind
    (("C-x m" . mu4e-compose-new)

This is the end of init. If we've arrived here it means that Emacs has started, so might as well get a notification about that:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (if (and (daemonp)
           (display-graphic-p))
      (alert "Emacs has started!"
             :title "Emacs"
             :style 'libnotify
             :severity 'trivial))
#+END_SRC
